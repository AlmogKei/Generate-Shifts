                                                   Security Guard Shift Scheduler


                                                             Overview
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
As a security guard, I have developed the "Security Guard Shift Scheduler" program to automate the process of creating weekly shift schedules for our team. The program allows each guard to input their shift preferences for each day, and it intelligently generates a fair and balanced schedule based on the provided preferences.

                                                             Features
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Guards can easily input their shift preferences, specifying preferred shift options for each day.
The program utilizes randomization and algorithmic optimization to efficiently assign shifts among all guards, ensuring an equitable distribution of work hours.
Constraints such as maximum and minimum working hours per day are considered to prevent guard overloading and promote a healthy work-life balance.

                                                            How to Use
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Run the program, and it will prompt each guard to provide their shift preferences.
Guards will select from five shift options for each day: "Short Morning," "Short Evening," "Short Night," "Long Morning," and "Long Night."
After inputting all preferences, the program will generate the weekly schedule, clearly displaying when each guard starts and ends their shifts.

                                                             Benefits
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Saves time and effort by automating the shift scheduling process, reducing manual work.
Guarantees a fair and efficient distribution of shifts, considering each guard's preferences and constraints.
Enhances team communication and coordination, as guards will have advance knowledge of their work hours, leading to smoother operations.

                                                           How It Works
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The program collects shift preferences from all six guards for each day of the week.
Using randomization, the program shuffles the order of guards to ensure even distribution.
For each day, the program assigns shifts based on guards' preferences and constraints.
The assigned shifts are displayed on the screen, showing the start and end times for each guard.
